# pre-work-studyguide


## Description
My motivation was to create a website which would be efficiently be able to store and create and manipulate information that I would learn in the pre work bootcamp, and do it to the best of my ability.I built this project because it was truely an exercise of all the things that I learned and truely helped me get into the flow of things in the website.It solves the problem of how to create a sample website with the tools that I learned. I learned the tools to manipulate information and to create and use the tools of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create a website.
