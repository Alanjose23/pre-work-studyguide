## Description
My motivation for building this project was to create a review website where I could look back and reflect on how far and how much effort I put into the creation of something in coding and how impactful it is. I built this project as a groundwork for a better idea of how to introcude several elements of coding, esspecially Front End development in the code.I built this as the solution to the problem of a small and quick summary of the coding matieral I learned while in the precursor part of the bootcamp. I learned the values of perserverance and how you can continously change or improve your code.

## Usage

Each section is specific to a portion of the learning that I have learned in the part of the bootcamp, but the essential lessons and summary of the portions include a section on Git, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a website with character. You can use this website as a way of keeping notes, a way of organizing thoughts on ideas or expansion of the specific sections of code. All in all, this code was an essential method of creating and maintaining a great and task specific website.
